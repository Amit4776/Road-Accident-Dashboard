# Road-Accident- Analysis Project


# Project Overview  

This project focuses on Analysing Road Accident using Excel and dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of
road accidents, highlighting key trends and statistic.

# Requirement
 * Primary KPI- Total casualties taken place  after accident
 * Primary KPI's-Total casualties& percentage of total with respect to accident sevarity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle
 * Secondary KPI's-Total casualties with respect to vehicle type 
 * Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current and previous year
 * Maximum casualties by road type
 * distribution of casualties by road surface
 * Relation between Area/Location and Day/night
# Data cleaning 
only one records found

# Data transformation

* Deleted Day_of_week column due to inconsistency,
* created new column such as Accident_day,Accident_month,Accident_year 
* Extracted day,month,yeard based on Accident_date column using TEXT function
* Replace values Fetal to Fatal for consistenccy, readability in Accident_sevarity column

  # Data Analysis & Dashboard

  # overall;
   * High Casualties: A total of 417,882 casualties were recorded, with the majority (84.1%) categorized as slight injuries.
   * Car Dominance: Cars are the most frequently involved vehicles in accidents, contributing to 79.8% of casualties.
   
 # Trends:
  * Time of Day: Nighttime accidents are more frequent, with 305,000 casualties compared to 112,900 during daylight hours.
  
 # Risk Factors:

  * Road Type: Dual carriageways and roundabouts appear to be the most dangerous road types, accounting for a combined 50.8% of casualties.
  * Weather Conditions: Wet road conditions pose a higher risk, with 115,340 casualties compared to 279,400 on dry roads.
  * Location: Urban areas have a higher concentration of casualties (62.0%) compared to rural areas.
  # Recommendations:

Focus on Prevention: The high number of slight injuries indicates a need for improved road safety measures to prevent accidents altogether.
This could include driver education programs, public awareness campaigns, and stricter enforcement of traffic laws.
Targeted Interventions: Focusing on road safety initiatives in urban areas and on specific road types like dual carriageways and roundabouts could significantly
reduce the number of casualties.
Infrastructure Improvements: Investing in road infrastructure improvements, such as better drainage systems, improved signage, and safer road designs, 
can help mitigate the risks associated with wet road conditions and specific road types.

# conclusion
This project analysis will be helpful for decision maker though they can leverage and take decision how  to improve Road accident prevention.
